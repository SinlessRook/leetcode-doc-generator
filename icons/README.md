# Extension Icons

This directory contains the extension icons in three sizes:
- icon16.png (16x16) - Used in the extension toolbar
- icon48.png (48x48) - Used in the extension management page
- icon128.png (128x128) - Used in the Chrome Web Store

## TODO
Create actual icon images for the extension. For now, placeholder files are needed.

To create icons:
1. Design a simple icon representing documentation/LeetCode
2. Export in three sizes: 16x16, 48x48, 128x128
3. Save as PNG files with the names above
